    "This bit was relatively easy to deal with. We've introduced pronouns, who are split (so far) into two categories by their case: Nominative (He, she etc) and accusative (her, them) etc. Nominative pronouns appear in the beginning of sentences, accusative ones in the end. So we've added pronouns as an alternative to NPs in the appropriate places.

One of the weaknesses of our grammar (as we demonstrate in the next question), is not separating singluar and plural nouns. So a possible solution to deal with the problem is to separate the category NP into NP_PL and NP_SIN (plural and singular). After we split it, we can safely treat \"NP_PL or NP_PL\" as plural (similar to \"they\"), and \"NP_SIN or NP_SIN\" as singluar (similar to he/she). \n",
