    "This bit was relatively easy to deal with. We've introduced pronouns, who are split (so far) into two categories by their case: Nominative (He, she etc) and accusative (her, them) etc. Nominative pronouns appear in the beginning of sentences, accusative ones in the end. So we've added pronouns as an alternative to NPs in the appropriate places.
